### Project Overview

 The project consist of the dataset for the census of certain country with roughly a 1000 entries and having various columns like age,income education,race,sex,capital,hours-per week etc. Thus working on this dataset in form of Numpy arrays help us gain values like average population age ,
average income , etc.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project i learnt aspects like: converting .csv file into numpy arrays . Applying concepts like indexing,slicing vectorization and inbuilt methods of NUMPY arrays to gain some working knowledge about it.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 (1) First converting the respective .csv file into NUMPY arrays .
(2)By appling Boolean Masking and slicing concept to meet respective condition and obtain subset array form the original array.
(3)Gaining the respective result .
